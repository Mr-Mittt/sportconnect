# A25 · Error code audit: sport module

**Status:** `TODO`
**Type:** Enhancement
**Program:** Error handling · Phase B
**Depends on:** C12 (common)
**Filed:** 2026-10-02, from the I18N-4 review (`documentation/md/I18N_READINESS.md`): the client has no general error handling and the backend has no machine-readable error code. Program design and phase tracker: `documentation/md/ERROR_HANDLING_DESIGN.md`.

## What
Phase B of the error-handling program for **sport**: (1) **check** every user-reachable endpoint of the module (controller → service throw sites, `-api` exceptions, `@Valid` messages, `ApiResponse.error` literals); (2) **categorize** each error with the C12 taxonomy and decide whether it is client-actionable or generic; (3) **define codes** for the actionable ones (with `errorParams` for interpolated values) and record them in `documentation/md/ERROR_CODES.md`; (4) convert the throw sites to coded exceptions; (5) cover the authorization/not-found boundaries with ITs; (6) confirm the paired client ticket **CLIENT-ERR-4** lists the final codes.

**Scope:** sport catalog, user sport profiles (create/update/deactivate/reactivate), attribute-schema read/replace, admin sport editing.

**Known messages to start from (not exhaustive — the audit finds the rest):** `User already has a profile for sport: <name>`, `Invalid sport profile attributes`, `Sport profile attributes exceed the maximum allowed size (4KB)`, `Sport with name '<name>' already exists`, `You can only update/delete/view your own sport profile`, `ResourceNotFoundException("Sport", "id", id)`.

**Deliverable — audit table (fill in at pickup):**

| Endpoint | Error / current message | Category | Code | Params | Client behavior (inline / page state / toast / generic) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| _to be filled during the audit_ | | | | | |

**Account lifecycle:** the audit also records what a deactivated caller receives per endpoint (CLAUDE.md § Account lifecycle).
**Client-visible enum check (CLIENT-NOTIF-4):** new codes are client-visible; the client case is **CLIENT-ERR-4**, filed alongside this ticket.

**Out of scope:** Other modules (their own Phase B ticket); the client copy and page states (the paired CLIENT-ERR ticket, filed alongside this one); a backend message catalog; deactivated-user token gaps (U12).

**Tests:** Spock coverage asserting `errorCode`/`errorParams` beside each updated `message`; `server` ITs through the real pipeline for the module's authorization/not-found boundaries (status + `errorCode`), per the CLAUDE.md IT rule.

**On close:** update this ticket's row in the tracker table in `documentation/md/ERROR_HANDLING_DESIGN.md` (and the module's `BACKLOG_MVP.md`/`PROGRESS.md` as usual).
